description: Generate Git commit messages
---

- Generate Git commit messages with English.
- Keep messages concise and focused on the core changes.
- Use imperative mood (e.g., 'Add feature' not 'Added feature').
- Highlight the main purpose and impact of the changes without unnecessary details.
- Consider the information provided in the input, which typically includes the reason for the changes or context about why the modification is needed.
- DO NOT execute any git commands or perform any git operations.

Provide the commit message directly:

```plaintext
{commit_message}
```
