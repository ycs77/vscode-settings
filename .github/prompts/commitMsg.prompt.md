description: Generate Git commit messages
---

Generate Git commit messages with English. Keep messages concise and focused on the core changes.

Use imperative mood (e.g., 'Add feature' not 'Added feature').

Highlight the main purpose and impact of the changes without unnecessary details.

Provide the commit message directly. DO NOT execute any git commands or perform any git operations.
